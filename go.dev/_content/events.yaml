  description: "All Gophers and curious software professionals are welcome to come
    discuss Go and related topics.<br/>\nGo is a Google-funded language for massively-scalable
    distributed systems that is statically typed and compiled. It has quickly stabilized
    and is running head-to-head with C++, Java, C#, etc. (<a href=\"https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/faster/go.html\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game - Go</a>). However, a larger-than-expected
    portion of new Gophers is made up of dynamic/interpreted language users who tend
    to be seeking relief from the cruft in their current languages and/or a more clear
    future within the horizontally-growing landscape of modern computing.<br/>\nIf
    you&#39;re building web apps, designing APIs, thrive on scalability, or you&#39;re
    simply curious about this fun new(ish) language, let&#39;s meetup.<br/>\n• More

    (from golang.org) <br><br/>
     <br/>
    The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It&#39;s a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
