Summary: Announcing the draft designs for the major Go 2 changes.

Yesterday, at our annual Go contributor summit,
attendees got a sneak peek at preliminary _drafts_ of
possible designs for changes to error handling and generics.
[The development of Go 2](https://docs.studygolang.com/blog/toward-go2) was announced last year and we are excited to share updates with you today.

For a quick overview, watch this short message we just played at Gophercon 2018:
